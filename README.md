# About
SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA), and is a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard

# How to run
1. Clone the repository and cd into the sha256 directory
2. Compile - `gcc  sha256.c  -o sha256`
3. Execute - `./sha256 test.txt`

# Implementation
This project was completed entirely using VIM on Google Cloud. It was completed through the help of our lecturer Dr Ian McLoughlin.
Time was taken to research about the SHA algorithm, and to learn some C fundamentals.

#Testing
There is a test.txt file which contains the plain text Danielis Joniskis. The expected Hash for this text is 3a5a75009b5ec9e6eb6697f074bb05f0635def15e97e7e7d165745121e7bb5b2.
